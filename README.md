# PWC-Switzerland-Customer-Churn-and-Risk-Analysis

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer churn data to uncover the key drivers of attrition and identify customer risk factors. Using the dataset (02 Churn-Dataset.xlsx), several interactive dashboards were developed in Power BI to provide a 360° view of churn patterns, including demographic factors, services usage, contracts, payment methods, and support interactions.

The dashboards are:
1. Customer Churn Dashboard – Overall churn statistics, demographics, and contract/payment insights.

2. Customer Risk Dashboard – Risk patterns across internet service types, tickets, and charges.

3. Services Dashboard – Analysis of service subscriptions (security, backup, streaming, tech support).

4. Insights & Recommendations Dashboard – Strategic business insights and recommendations to reduce churn.

## Project Objectives

1. Measure and monitor customer churn rate and key financial metrics (monthly/yearly charges).

2. Identify high-risk groups based on service usage, contract type, and internet services.

3. Analyze the impact of services and support (security, backup, tech support) on retention.

4. Recommend data-driven strategies for customer retention and churn reduction.

## Key Insights

#### Customer Churn Overview:

1. Out of 7,043 customers, 1,869 (27%) churned.

2. Churn is evenly split across gender (Male 49.5%, Female 50.5%).

3. Contracts:

     3.1- Month-to-Month contracts account for 55% of churn.

     3.2- Customers on 1-year and 2-year contracts are far less likely to churn.

4. Payment Method: Electronic check users churn the most (33.6%).

5. Tenure Effect: 31% of churned customers left within the first year, highlighting early-stage disengagement risk.

1. Internet Services:

    1.1 Fiber optic users have the highest churn (42%).

    1.2 DSL users (19%) churn less frequently.

2. Tickets: Churned customers had significantly more Admin Tickets (2,173) and Tech Tickets (885) than retained customers.

3. Charges: High monthly charges correlate with higher churn risk, particularly among fiber optic customers.

4. Contracts: Month-to-month customers exhibit the highest churn risk, while 2-year contract customers are the most stable.

#### Services Analysis:

1. Churned customers were less likely to subscribe to value-added services such as:

    1.1 Online Security (only 29% had it).

    1.2 Tech Support (31% had it).

    1.3 Online Backup (35% had it).

2. Customers without these services showed higher churn rates, suggesting that bundled services improve retention.

3. Streaming services (TV/Movies) had minimal impact compared to security and support services.

### Insights & Recommendations

1. Early Churn Risk: Recently joined customers are more likely to leave; onboarding and early engagement are critical.

2. High-Risk Segments: Fiber optic users and electronic check payers are most vulnerable.

3. Support Factor: Customers who opened more tickets are likelier to churn, indicating dissatisfaction with services.

4. Actionable Recommendations:
   
   4.1 Promote 1-year and 2-year contracts with incentives (e.g., discounts, loyalty programs).

   4.2 Encourage customers to adopt Online Security and Tech Support services through awareness campaigns.

   4.3 Offer discounts or rewards for customers at risk, especially those on month-to-month contracts.

   4.4 Target a 5% annual increase in long-term contracts and automatic payments.

### Conclusion

Customer churn is largely driven by contract type, internet service type, and lack of value-added services. Customers with month-to-month contracts, fiber optic internet, and electronic check payments represent the highest churn risk.

By implementing proactive measures—such as promoting long-term contracts, incentivizing bundled services, and improving customer support—the company can significantly reduce churn, improve customer lifetime value, and increase profitability.
